# Role-Based Access Control and Natural Language to SQL Conversion with Llama 3 

---

#### **Introduction**

This repository contains the source code for a rbaC application designed to convert natural language queries into SQL commands. The application leverages the **LangChain framework** with the **ChatGroq API** and integrates SQL database interactions. It supports user authentication and role-based access control, ensuring secure and structured interactions.

---

### **Features**

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
   - Admin, Moderator, and User roles are supported with specific permissions.
   - Access is granted or denied based on user roles.
   
2. **Natural Language to SQL Conversion:**
   - The chatbot interprets user queries in plain English and generates SQL code to fetch data from the database.

3. **Database Integration:**
   - The application uses SQLite for data storage and manipulation.
   - Includes predefined tables and sample data for users and roles.

4. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Secure user login via **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.
   - Passwords are securely hashed using **bcrypt**.

5. **Dynamic Karma System:**
   - Tracks user behavior based on access attempts.
   - Grants or deducts "karma" points based on permissions.

### **Codebase Overview**

#### **1. File Structure**
- **`bot.py`**: Implements the chatbot using the ChatGroq API for SQL conversion.
- **`main.py`**: Manages the Flask application, routes, and API endpoints.
- **`models.py`**: Handles database operations (creation and query execution).
- **`utils.py`**: Contains utilities such as role-based access control.
- **`config.py`**: Stores configuration variables like database path and secret key.

---

### **Detailed Walkthrough**

#### **1. `bot.py`**
The chatbot uses the **LangChain ChatGroq API** to process English queries and convert them into SQL commands. 

- **Key Components:**
  - **System Message Context:** Provides instructions and schema details for accurate SQL generation.
  - **Few-Shot Examples:** Demonstrates examples of questions and their corresponding SQL responses to improve model performance.
  - **`ask` Function:** Handles user queries and integrates responses into the application flow.

#### **2. `main.py`**
This is the Flask applicationâ€™s core file. It provides API endpoints for authentication, user operations, and chatbot interactions.

- **Endpoints:**
  - `/register`: Allows user registration with optional role assignment.
  - `/login`: Authenticates users and issues JWT tokens.
  - `/chat`: Processes user queries, generates SQL, executes it, and returns the results (admin/mod-only access).
  - `/admin`, `/mod`, `/user`: Provide role-specific resources and responses.

#### **3. `models.py`**
Manages SQLite database interactions.

- **Functions:**
  - `create_table`: Creates the `user_details` table with predefined columns (e.g., `id`, `role`, `username`, `karma`).
  - `execute_query`: Executes SQL queries with support for fetch, commit, and parameterized inputs.

#### **4. `utils.py`**
Provides helper utilities like role-based access control.

- **`role_required`:**
  - Validates user roles before accessing endpoints.
  - Adjusts user karma based on access behavior (penalizes unauthorized attempts).

#### **5. `config.py`**
Contains essential configuration data:
- `SECRET_KEY`: Used for securing JWT tokens.
- `DATABASE`: Path to the SQLite database file.

### **Database Schema**

#### **`user_details` Table**
| Column   | Type      | Attributes                       |
|----------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| `id`     | INTEGER   | Primary Key, Auto Increment      |
| `role`   | INTEGER   | 0=Admin, 1=Moderator, 2=User     |
| `username` | TEXT    | Unique, Not Null                 |
| `password` | TEXT    | Not Null                         |
| `name`   | TEXT      | Optional                         |
| `karma`  | DOUBLE    | Defaults to 0                    |

### **Environment Setup**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.9.18
   - SQLite
   - Virtual environment tools (optional but recommended)

2. **Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file with the following:
     ```
     GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_api_key>
     ```

3. **Dependencies:**
   Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Database Initialization:**
   - Ensure the database file `database.db` is in place.
   - The table `user_details` will be created automatically on the first run.

5. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### **How It Works**

1. **Registration and Login:**
   - Users can register with a username, password, and name. A role can be optionally assigned during registration.
   - Login authenticates users and provides a JWT token.

2. **Role-Based Queries:**
   - Admin and Moderator roles can access the `/chat` endpoint to process SQL queries via natural language.
   - Unauthorized attempts lead to karma reduction.

3. **Chat Functionality:**
   - The `/chat` endpoint accepts a user query (e.g., *"How many admins are there?"*).
   - Converts it to SQL: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_details WHERE role=0`.
   - Executes the query on the database and returns the results.
